# 2048 Game 🎮 – Vanilla JavaScript

A clean and fully functional clone of the classic **2048 game**, built from scratch using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**.  
This project helped me understand core DOM manipulation, event handling, game logic, local storage, and GitHub Pages deployment.

## 🌟 Features

- 4×4 playable grid that responds to arrow keys
- Tiles merge logically (2048-style) in all four directions
- Tracks current score and high score
- High score is saved using **LocalStorage**
- **Game over** detection with alert
- **Victory detection** when a tile reaches 2048
- Responsive and visually styled tiles with color-coded numbers
- **Restart button** to reset the game instantly
- Hosted live using **GitHub Pages**
